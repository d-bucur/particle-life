# bugs
- still some asserts?
- weird effect in corners (can observer with maximum eq distance)
- unstable with lots of particles. Maybe VV or changing params can help

# optimizations
- multithreading on desktop
- soa and break operations (separate integration etc)

# features
- repeating scene
- use velocity verlet?
- genetic evolution of weights, collisions to make particles fight etc. should be separate branch
- better ui
