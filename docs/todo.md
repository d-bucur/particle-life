# bugs
- unstable with lots of particles. Maybe VV or changing params can help
- weird effect in corners (can observe with maximum eq distance)

# optimizations

# features
- repeating scene
- use velocity verlet?
- genetic evolution of weights, collisions to make particles fight etc. should be separate branch
- better ui
